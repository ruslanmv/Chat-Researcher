class ePrint:
    """
    Class for storing the data associated with an e-print available on
    arxiv.org. This class is not intended for manual use (i.e. the
    values of the class arguments should be obtained *only* from a
    query of the arXiv API and not specified by hand).

    Parameters
    ----------
    title : str
        The title of the arXiv e-print.
    authors : list[str]
        The author(s) of the arXiv e-print.
    abstract : str
        The abstract of the arXiv e-print.
    comment : Union[str, None]
        Any comments associated with the arXiv e-print.
        Note: not all e-prints have associated comments. In this case,
        it is recommended to set `comment` to `None`.
    primary_category : str
        The primary category associated with the arXiv e-print
        (e.g. astro-ph.EP).
    all_categories : list[str]
        All categories associated with the arXiv e-print.
    arxiv_id : str
        The arXiv ID of the arXiv e-print.
    abs_url : str
        The URL of the abstract of the arXiv e-print.
    pdf_url : str
        The URL of the .pdf of the arXiv e-print.
    doi : Union[str, None]
        The DOI of the publication associated with the arXiv e-print.
        Note: not all e-prints are associated with a publication that
        has a DOI. In this case, it is recommended to set `doi` to
        `None`.
    doi_url : Union[str, None]
        The DOI URL of the publication associated with the arXiv
        e-print. Note: not all e-prints are associated with a
        publication that has a DOI. In this case, it is recommended to
        set `doi_url` to `None`.
    journal_ref : Union[str, None]
        The journal reference of the publication associated with the
        arXiv e-print. Note: not all e-prints are associated with a 
        publication. In this case, it is recommended to set
        `journal_ref` to `None`.
    date_submitted : datetime.date
        The date the arXiv e-print was submitted. Note that the date an
        e-print was submitted does not necessarily correspond to the
        date it became available to the public.
    date_updated : datetime.date
        The date the arXiv e-print was last updated.

    def summary(self, detail: str = "low") -> str:
        """
        Method that generates a summary of the data associated with the
        arXiv e-print represented by the given instance of `ePrint`.
        Two levels of detail are possible: `'low'` and `'high'`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        detail : str, default 'low'
